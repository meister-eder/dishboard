# Dishboard

This is a sample project built with Vue 3 (with composition api) and a simple express backend.
It allows the user to create, view and update dishes for a restaurant

I used Vite as a bundler and Vuetify for UI components.

## Setup

### API

Go to api folder and run

```
npm install
npm start
```

The API will be accessible at localhost:9000 by default

### Client

Go to client folder and run

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

The client is running at localhost:3000

### Docker compose (recommended)

Run this command from the root directory

```
docker-compose up
```
